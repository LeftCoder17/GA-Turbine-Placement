## Brief description
The problem consists of determining the optimal placement of wind turbines, balancing maximum production capacity with constraints on the number of turbines installed and the land occupied by each wind farm. Therefore, the objective is to maximize the power production function while simultaneously minimizing the cost function associated with the optimal placement of wind turbines. 

Specifically, three cases are considered, as in the mentioned study:

a) Unidirectional uniform wind.

b) Uniform wind with variable direction.

c) Non-uniform wind with variable direction.
